# UFOs, the truth is out there!

# Module 11 Challenge.
# UFOs Sightings website
The website has been finished, and the article is ready to go, but after a final look at her work, Dana feels that it could be improved even more. Instead of filtering by a single item, why not provide her readers with the ability to filter by multiple factors? The ability to search a city or country or even combine a date with a location would make Dana's application that much more robust.

## Website info:
Website uses Javscript code to initalize and filter a javascript data table of UFO sightings. Dynamic code that can utilize any properly formatted data.js file- so the website can be easily updated with that one file. data can be filtered using a combination of:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country 
- Shape of sighting

## enhancements
Website was adjusted to accept only lowcase input (since the table is all in lower case) Other visual formatting added such as alternate color rows for better visability
